AreaCrime: Used Rdd to find count of the top crime areas and the ones with the least.
What was used is similar to what was done in the labs and assignments.
Split(), ReduceByKey(), SortBy(), Take()
Learned where to and NOT to go in LA. This information was very useful.
Scala makes it incredibly easy to find this information and visualize it.

Weapon Trends: Also used an RDD on the file to find the top common weapons used. I used
the methods commonly discussed in class like:
Split(), ReduceByKey(), SortBy(), Take()
Finding this information was a little odd because not all crimes done
involved a weapon. So a there were a lot of blank fields and mismatched data.
